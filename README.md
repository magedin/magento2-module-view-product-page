#### This module adds some buttons to enable the store owner to visit the product page on the front store by clicking on a single button on the admin product edit page.

## Compatibility

For Magento 2.3 and later.

You can download this module and install it directly in your Magento `app/code` directory but I really recommend you install using `composer` installation process described below.
